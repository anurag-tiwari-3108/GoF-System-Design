# Project Architecture

This project implements classic Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns in Java, organized by pattern type:

- **Behavioral**: Patterns that manage object collaboration and responsibilities.
- **Creational**: Patterns that handle object creation mechanisms.
- **Structural**: Patterns that simplify relationships between objects.

## Directory Structure

- `src/main/java/com/codex/dp/creation/` — Creational patterns
- `src/main/java/com/codex/dp/structural/` — Structural patterns
- `src/test/java/` — Unit tests
- `docs/` — Documentation and diagrams

## Build & Test
- Use Maven: `mvn clean install`
- Tests are in `src/test/java`
