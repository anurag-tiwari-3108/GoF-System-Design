# Mediator Pattern

**Intent:** Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.

**How it works:**
- Mediator object handles communication between objects.
- Reduces direct dependencies between objects.

**Layman Example:** Chat room mediator for users.

**Key Classes:**
- `ChatRoom`, `User`

**Demo:** See `MediatorDemo.java` for usage.
