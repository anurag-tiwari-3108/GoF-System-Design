# Prototype Pattern

**Intent:** Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

**How it works:**
- Objects implement a `clone()` method.
- New objects are created by copying an existing object (prototype).

**Layman Example:** Cloning an employee list for different departments.

**Key Classes:**
- `EmployeePrototype`

**Demo:** See `PrototypeDemo.java` for usage.
