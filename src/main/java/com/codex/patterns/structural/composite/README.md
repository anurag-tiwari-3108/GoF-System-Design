# Composite Pattern

**Intent:** Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

**How it works:**
- Component interface for all objects in the composition.
- Leaf and composite classes implement the component interface.

**Layman Example:** File system with folders and files.

**Key Classes:**
- `FileSystemComponent`, `File`, `Folder`

**Demo:** See `CompositeDemo.java` for usage.
