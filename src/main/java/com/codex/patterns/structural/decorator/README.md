# Decorator Pattern

**Intent:** Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

**How it works:**
- Decorator class wraps the original object and adds new behavior.
- Both implement a common interface.

**Layman Example:** Coffee with add-ons (milk, sugar).

**Key Classes:**
- `Coffee`, `SimpleCoffee`, `MilkDecorator`, `SugarDecorator`

**Demo:** See `DecoratorDemo.java` for usage.
