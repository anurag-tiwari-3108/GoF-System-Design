# Facade Pattern

**Intent:** Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

**How it works:**
- Facade class wraps complex subsystem and provides simple methods for clients.

**Layman Example:** Home theater system with a single remote.

**Key Classes:**
- `HomeTheaterFacade`, `DVDPlayer`, `Projector`, `SoundSystem`

**Demo:** See `FacadeDemo.java` for usage.
